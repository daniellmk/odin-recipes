         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p>"We make this baked bow tie pasta for Halloween every year at my son's request! It's like spaghetti using bow tie pasta. It is mixed together with mozzarella cheese cubes and baked in the oven. The bow tie pasta is the bats and the stringy, gooey mozzarella cheese is the cobwebs!" - Kristin</p>
